## Installation

Clone this repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ha0Tang/BiGraphGAN
cd BiGraphGAN/facial
```

## Dataset Preparation

Please follow [C2GAN](https://github.com/Ha0Tang/C2GAN#dataset-preparation) to directly download the facial dataset.

This repository uses the same dataset format as [SelectionGAN](https://github.com/Ha0Tang/SelectionGAN/tree/master/person_transfer#data-preperation) and [C2GAN](https://github.com/Ha0Tang/C2GAN#dataset-preparation). so you can use the same data for all these methods.

## Generating Images Using Pretrained Model
```bash
cd scripts/
sh download_bigraphgan_model.sh facial
```
Note: Please try to execute the command line a second time, if it doesnâ€™t work the first time.

Then,
1. Change several parameters in `test_facial.sh`.
2. Run `sh test_facial.sh` for testing.

## Train and Test New Models
1. Change several parameters in `train_facial.sh`.
2. Run `sh train_facial.sh` for training.
3. Change several parameters in `test_facial.sh`.
4. Run `sh test_facial.sh` for testing.

## Download Images Produced by the Authors
**For your convenience, you can directly download the images produced by the authors for qualitative comparisons in your own papers!!!**

```bash
cd scripts/
sh download_bigraphgan_result.sh facial
```

## Evaluation
We adopt SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS for evaluation of Market-1501. Please refer to [C2GAN](https://github.com/Ha0Tang/C2GAN) for more details.
